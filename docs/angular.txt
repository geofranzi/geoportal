Notes about how Angular works

- specify Angular app in html-tag
- Angular app has Services, Controllers, Directives etc.
    - base structure is:
        var app = angular.module(...)
        app.controller("...Ctrl", function() ...).services(...) etc.
    - run-method as an equivalent to window.onload
- Scopes have a method "$broadcast(name, args)" to fire events (even custom ones)
