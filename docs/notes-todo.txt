BaseLayers:
- user should be able to choose between different base layers (a.k.a. which map is loaded initially as the bottom-most
layer)
- currently implemented: Google Maps
- atm this is static, might have to make this dynamic somehow later down the line
- TODO: build logic for using the baselayer the user chose

Popups:
- try to figure out, what this code does and reimplement it in LL terms

Control Flow:
- user opens webpage
- mapjs:initialize is called
    - fetches initial map data via REST
    - convert base layers into format for OL/LL
    - create the map
    -
