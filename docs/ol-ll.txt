Notes about conversion from OpenLayers3 to Leaflet
- Layers:
    - both: layers have a url template, its placeholders are filled via parameters
    - OL3: ol.source.<CLASS>
    - LL: L.tileLayer(urlTemplate, objectWithOptions)  <- params are provided in latter parameter

Plugins, that might be required/useful:
- https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers
    - configurations for different map providers like OSM, MapQuest, etc.
- https://github.com/gmaclennan/leaflet-bing-layer
    - the same for BingMaps
